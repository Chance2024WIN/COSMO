## These scripts are hardcoded.

The script "predicted_operons_counts_per_lineage.py" takes in:
1. All files produced by COSMO and
2. The 50_combined_operon_list.txt file

Input files had names such as:
C5_CONT1_D2_d1_F5_f5.csv
C5_RIF1_D2_d1_F5_f5.csv, where
(C5 = strain name; CONT1 = first control; RIF1 = first experimental RIF strain, 
D2 = min expression CDS, d2 = min expression IGR; 
F5 = max DF between CDSs; f5 = max FD betw IGR and flanking CDS



The script "count_intersec_calls_across_lineage.py" is only appropriate for testing files 
produced by using the previous python script "predicted_operons_counts_per_lineage.py" ABOVE

The "predicted_operons_counts_per_lineage.py" produced files per lineage and per condition
which have extension names ending in "D2_calls_&_cov_all_lineages.txt".
Note that because this script had as input the file names above where controls had
"CONT" in the file name and experimental files had "RIF" (rifampicin) in their name,
the script finds files with the same name format.
