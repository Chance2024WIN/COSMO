##Files used for testing the parameters of COSMO##

The python scripts, wiggle files and coordinates files in this directory 
all work/run together 

The folder **Python_scripts** folder are to be used for calculating PPVs and calcuating genomic region averages

The scripts in **python_scripts_for_prediction_calls** are hardcoded for calculating predictions (TP, FP, TN),
so the README in that folder **must** be carefully read to mimic input file names
